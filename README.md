# Test Automation in Clojure
#### Wesley Matson
##### Clearwater Developer Conference 2018

As an immutable-by-default, data-first, functional language, Clojure leads naturally to a testable design. Together, we'll explore some of Clojure's testing utilities and libraries. This will include a short segment on testing Java via Clojure interop as well as several comparisons of clojure.test with JUnit. I expect only a modicum of syntax familiarity (data literals and function calls, primarily), so beginner Clojurists are welcome to attend!
